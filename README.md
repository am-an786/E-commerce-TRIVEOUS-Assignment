## API Endpoints
  ### Public URLs 
  Public URLs are accessible to anyone, including users who are not authenticated. These URLs typically include endpoints for general information or actions that do not require user-specific or privileged data. In an e-commerce application, public URLs could be used for features like user registration, fetching product details, or retrieving general information that doesn't depend on the user's identity.
  
        POST /triv/auth/users/signup :- User registration
        POST /triv/auth/admins/signup   :- Admin registration
        GET /triv/public/all-categories :- Get all categories
        GET /triv/public/get-product-of-specific-category/{categoryId}  :- Get products of a specific category
        GET /triv/public/get-product/{productId}    :-  Get details of a specific product
        GET /triv/public/all-products   :-  Get all products

  ### User and Admin URLs
  User and Admin URLs represent endpoints that require authentication and are categorized based on the user roleâ€”either user or admin. These URLs often involve actions related to user accounts, authentication, or other operations that require a certain level of privilege.
  
        POST /triv/auth/users/signin :- User authentication
        POST /triv/auth/admins/signin   :- Admin authentication
        PUT /triv/auth/users/update-user    :- Update user information

  ### User URLs
  User URLs are designed for actions and features that regular authenticated users can access. These URLs often involve operations that are relevant to individual user accounts, such as managing their shopping cart, viewing order history, or updating personal information.
  
        POST /triv/users/addProduct-to-cart/{productId}/{quantity} :- Add a product to the cart
        GET /triv/users/getAllProducts-from-cart :- Get all products from the cart
        PUT /triv/users/update-quantity-of-product-in-cart/{quantity} :- Update quantity of a product in the cart

   ### Admin URLs
   Admin URLs are designed for users with administrative privileges. These endpoints typically involve actions that are reserved for administrators, such as managing users, adding new categories, or saving new products.
   
        DELETE /triv/admins/delete-user :- Delete a user
        POST /triv/admins/save-category :- Save a new category
        POST /triv/admins/save-product :- Save a new product

## Authentication and Authorization
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication and authorization. Make sure to select Basic Authentication in the Authorization settings when making requests. Provide the username and password used during registration. A JWT token will be received in the Headers section labeled as "Authorization." Retain this JWT token for further requests.
